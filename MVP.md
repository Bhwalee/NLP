From the dataset I found from Kaggle, I wanted to figure out subgenres for horror movies from IMSDB. There are many subgenres in horror movies such as gothic, sci-fi, animal theme, and thrill. Using NLP, I was able to gain new insight into these genres and deep dive into which movies belonged to which subgenre.<img width="351" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-08 at 9 55 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86501110/140870266-6ac9582e-cc2f-43f1-9dad-bb066ef4b5a1.png">
