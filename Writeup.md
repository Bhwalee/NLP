# What do vegetarians talk about? Finding most discussed topics

# Abstract
For the NLP (Natural Language Processing) project, I wanted to find out about what are the most common topics discussed among vegetarians. In the hope of finding a number of different topics, I would like to rank topics from most discussed to least discussed. By looking deep into these topics, I hope to gain greater insight as to what are most important things to remember and frequent controverisal topics that vegetarians vs non-vegetarians argue about. As a result, with greater insight gained from exploration, I would uncover themes that are always important to vegetarians.

# Design
Datasets are found in Twitter. I retrieved about 40K dataset by scrapping from the website. By using NLP and vectorization techniques, I wanted to figure out which topics that are always discussed on Twitter and find what are the subcategories of each topic. There are always common and frequent words associated with the topic and so by analyzing these words I hope to figure out the over-arching themes. 

# Data
Data is scrapped from Twtitter using Selenium and snscrape. 

# Algorithm
Using clustering techinques and topic modeling discussed in the class, I wanted to find out words that are always associated with given topics such as food, diet, animals. By gaining deeper insight into these topics, I can find out what are the things always discussed among vegetarians and what they always focus on. In return, I could gain greater insight into their diet, health, and lifestyle. Using tsne and other clustering techniques, I want to gain bigger picture by showing discussed topics in the different porportions..
