# NLP - Natural Language Processing

Summary:
Using data with primarily textual information, build unsupervised learning models that address a useful structure finding, topic modeling, and/or recommendation system problem in any domain of interest such as social media/online discussion, news media, product reviews, literature, or television writing. Communicate your process and findings in a 5 minute presentation (to the entire class at the end of week 2) and a short written description.

For this project, I would like to focus on three objectives - 
1. find principal components on the ratings, using NLP unsupervised machine learning
2. predict product ratings based on explicit reviews, using NLP supervised learning
3. recommend products to online shoppers based on purchase history using algorithm

The dataset I found from Kaggle is called, "Grammar and Online Product Reviews." Given many different columns, I will mainly focus on the review ratings ranging from 1 to 5 and review the comments where shoppers are free to express and describe their likes and dislikes about the product.
