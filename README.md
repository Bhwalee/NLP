# NLP - Natural Language Processing

Summary:
Using data with primarily textual information, build unsupervised learning models that address a useful structure finding, topic modeling, and/or recommendation system problem in any domain of interest such as social media/online discussion, news media, product reviews, literature, or television writing. Communicate your process and findings in a 5 minute presentation (to the entire class at the end of week 2) and a short written description.

For this project, I would like to focus on three objectives - 
1. Most discussed topics among vegetarians
2. upcoming topics in the future
3. find common words associated with the topic

Using snscrape, data will be retrieved from Twitter. My keyword would be #vegetarian. Using this keyword and I would like to find out what are the most discussed topic among the people and what topics are always discussed over the years.
